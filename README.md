# Gradio + OpenAI Chatbot (Streaming)

A simple chatbot web UI built with **Gradio ChatInterface** and the **OpenAI Python SDK**, with **streaming** responses.

## What it does
- Launches a local Gradio chat app in your browser
- Sends your message + chat history to the OpenAI Chat Completions API
- Streams tokens back live so the response appears gradually
